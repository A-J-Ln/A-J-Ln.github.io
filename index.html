            <p>
                Emerging in the late 1970s from Japan, CityPop is unofficially defined as a subgenre of J-pop (Japanese Pop) known for it's aesthetic qualities. CityPop is most recognizable through its retro visuals and bright colour palette. Containing upbeat and soulful elements, many songs of the genre can trace influences from West Coast pop, soft rock, funk, disco, R&B, and boogie. Most notable CityPop artists include:

            Why CDs?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Commonly associated with the nascent technologies of the time such as the Walkman, cassette decks and FM stereos, one of CityPop's defining mascots is undoubtable the cassette tape. However, while aesthetically pleasing, the cassette is generally falls behind in terms of sound quality and convenience. Unfortunately, due to its diminished use, cassette tapes are less common these days. This applies as well to cassette players or cars with built-in cassette decks. For those who prefer an older analog sound and nostalgic feel, the cassette is an excellent format for music. For the sake of convenience and sound quality, while not sacrificing as much nostalgic value, I have opted for the CD.

            Gaining popularity in the 1980s following the decline of cassette tapes, CDs reach a nice middle ground for those not quite ready to switch completely online. To individuals who value clean and accurate sound reproduction, the CDs is an amazing alternative to older formats. With a range of 96 dB, compared to cassettes with 50-75 dB, CDs also have the advantage of being better at differentiating between loud and quiet sections of a recording. Additionally, CDs are able to reproduce a wider range of frequencies, with a wider frequency response at 2Hz - 21 Hz. In contrast, the cassette tape is only capable of 20 Hz - 20 kHz. Another factor is cost. Due to the rarity of quality cassette players/recorders, most record labels and artist have opted to rerelease their music as CDs instead of cassettes. Saving cassette tape rereleases for special anniversaries or events, scarcity in product leads to increased prices and stock hording.
